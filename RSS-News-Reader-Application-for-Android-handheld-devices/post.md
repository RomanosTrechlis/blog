The application implements a simple RSS News feed reader. I started with a lot of auto-generated code and step by step I wrote my own code to fit the problem. A simple example is the implementation of list views. I started with auto-generated type and continue coding until I transformed it to one I liked.

The application has been tested on phone not on tablets, so I donâ€™t know what really happens when executed on one ;-).

This was my introduction to the world of Android devices programming.
